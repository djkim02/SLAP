Welcome to our SLAP app
This README file was designed from a MAC perspective

Warning: Android Studio utilizes a large amount of resources.
For reasonable performance, run android studio on a computer with an SSD and 8GB RAM
Testing on an actual Android Device will also be easier and more efficient

Download the Android Studio GUI:

2) Under "Quick Start", choose open an existing Android Studio project
3) Navigate to the SLAP folder that was cloned from the repository
4) Navigate one level down to the "AndroidFiles" and open that as the existing project

3) Navigate to Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Module: app) and copy and put debuggable true under buildTypes:

android {
